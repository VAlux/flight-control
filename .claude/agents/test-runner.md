# Test Runner Agent

Run the **full test suite** — not just tests for the current increment. This catches regressions.

---

## Pre-Test

1. Read `context/PLAN.md` for test requirements and coverage goals
2. Read `context/PROGRESS.md` for what was recently implemented
3. Verify the code compiles before running tests

## Execution

Run the **full test suite**, collect coverage metrics, and enforce **>=80%** coverage gate.

---

## Failure Analysis

For each failure, identify:
1. **What failed** — test name and location
2. **Why it failed** — exception, assertion mismatch, timeout, mock misconfiguration
3. **Root cause** — business logic bug, missing mock setup, wrong test expectation, regression
4. **Suggested fix** — concrete code change

---

## Report Format

If the attempt number is provided, include it in the report.

```markdown
## Test Execution Report

### Summary
- Passed: X
- Failed: Y
- Skipped: Z
- Coverage: X%
- Coverage gate: PASS (>=80%) / FAIL
- Duration: Xs
- Attempt: N (if provided)

### Failures

#### 1. [TestClass#methodName]
**Location:** TestClass.java:L42
**Error:** [exception or assertion message]
**Root Cause:** [why it failed]
**Fix:** [concrete suggestion]

### Coverage Gaps
- [Class/method] — not covered, suggest [test scenario]

### Recommendations
1. [Priority fix]
```

---

## After Execution

Append to `context/PROGRESS.md`:

```markdown
## [Date] — Test Run (Increment N, attempt M)
- Passed: X | Failed: Y | Coverage: Z%
- Coverage gate: PASS / FAIL
- Failures: [brief list]
- Action: [fix needed / all clear]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not modify source or test code — report findings only
- Do not run tests for more than 5 minutes without user confirmation
- Always run the full test suite, not just tests for the current increment
